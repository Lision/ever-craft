# Visual system

Read this reference before planning pages, writing prompts, creating anchors, or reviewing originality. Keep these decisions in the post's `visual-bible.yaml`.

## Fixed foundation

Produce 1080×1440 RGB PNG cards on a stable grid with generous whitespace, thin dividers, strong hierarchy, and low visual noise.

Use this exact default palette:

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#FAFAF8` | Warm-white page background |
| `surface` | `#F0F0EE` | Information blocks and pale sections |
| `ink` | `#0A0A08` | Titles, body text, and principal line art |
| `solid` | `#000000` | Character solids and maximum contrast |
| `accent` | `#012FA7` | Blue headings, labels, and emphasis blocks |
| `annotation` | `#854953` | Hand-drawn underline, arrow, or sparse annotation |
| `muted` | `#747472` | Headers, English kickers, and secondary information |
| `divider` | `#D1D1CF` | Dividers and weak boundaries |

Override colors only when the user explicitly requests another theme; write all eight replacement values into that post's `visual-bible.yaml`.

Use `Maple Mono NF CN` for every composed text element. Provide regular and bold font paths when discovery is unavailable. Fail explicitly if the family, required weight, Chinese glyph, or punctuation glyph is missing. Never fall back silently, bundle a font in the public skill, rasterize model-generated copy, shrink type to hide overflow, or bypass the renderer's checks.

## Choose one of four layouts

1. **Cover (`cover`)** — Use the largest title, least copy, strongest original metaphor, and broadest whitespace. Establish the whole article's thesis.
2. **Standard chapter (`standard`)** — Explain one chapter claim with one illustration region and a small number of supporting text blocks.
3. **Comparison/list (`comparison` or `list`)** — Use only for genuinely parallel, classified, sequential, or contrasted material. Give peer items equal visual rank; do not force prose into boxes.
4. **Summary (`summary`)** — Recombine the thesis into a conclusion, action, or interaction prompt. Do not repeat the entire article.

Split a page when its single claim cannot fit at the approved type scale. Keep title, body, illustration, divider, footer, signature, and safe margins inside the deterministic grid.

## Create original line art

Build each prompt from this recipe:

```text
Original minimal editorial line-art illustration for a Chinese social card;
[one approved subject] expresses [one approved relationship or change] through
[new spatial metaphor]; irregular hand-drawn ink contours, sparse flat shapes,
asymmetric balanced composition, generous warm-white negative space, restrained use
of the supplied exact palette, consistent line weight and complexity with the supplied
style anchor; no typography, letters, numbers, labels, signature, logo, or watermark.
```

Specify only the page's subject, relation, viewpoint, focal point, and needed anchor continuity. Ask for a transparent or clean background only when composition requires it. Keep lighting flat and detail sparse so deterministic typography remains dominant.

Exclude these concepts:

- photorealism, stock photography, 3D rendering, glossy gradients, cinematic lighting, complex shadows, texture noise, and decorative clutter;
- readable text, pseudo-Chinese glyphs, letters, numbers, labels, logos, watermarks, signatures, and account branding;
- copied mascots, recognizable proprietary characters, traced poses, exact reference compositions, or near-duplicates of individual reference illustrations;
- extra focal subjects, unexplained symbols, ornamental frames, and any element that competes with the page's one central claim.

## Use an optional original character

Default to one newly designed abstract character only when it improves narrative continuity. Define its unique silhouette, head/body ratio, eye form, limb construction, fill/outline treatment, line irregularity, and allowed viewpoints in `visual-bible.yaml`. Vary gesture and role by page while preserving those invariants.

Use the character as observer, actor, or bearer of a problem; do not let it become decorative branding. When the user disables characters, omit `character-sheet.png` and use objects, space, paths, barriers, scale, or abstract relationships instead. Never infer a character from a reference mascot.

## Build and pass anchors

Create `style-anchor.png` after Gate 1 to demonstrate line quality, exact palette, whitespace, density, contrast, and texture without copying any eventual page composition. When characters are enabled, create `character-sheet.png` with neutral front, side, and action views that lock the approved character invariants.

Pass `visual-bible.yaml`, `style-anchor.png`, and the optional `character-sheet.png` to every generation. For revisions, also pass the current illustration and only the routed review actions. Do not describe anchors from memory or replace them with a reference URL.

## Check originality

Use external references only to infer high-level qualities such as editorial restraint, whitespace, hierarchy, and simple line work. Before approval, compare the entire set and each card against the references:

- Reject matching character silhouettes, facial systems, distinctive props, poses, signatures, brand marks, or page-specific object combinations.
- Reject substantially matching subject placement, camera angle, visual path, or negative-space contour on a reference page.
- Require the new metaphor to follow the article's claim rather than the reference's scene.
- Record originality as an independent-review concern; route a local copied element to `image` and a repeated system-level resemblance to `system`.

Similarity in broad style alone is not a defect; similarity in protectable or page-specific expression is.
